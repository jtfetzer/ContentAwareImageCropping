  <h2 class="content">Seam Carving</h2>
  <p class="content"><br>Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by
    one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A <em>vertical seam</em> in an image is a path of pixels connected from
    the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row. (A <em>horizontal seam</em> is a path of pixels connected from the
    left to the right with one pixel in each column.) Below left is the original 505-by-287 pixel image;
    below right is the result after removing 150 vertical seams,
    resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (e.g. cropping and scaling),
    the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image are preserved. </p>
  <p class="content">To determine which seams to remove,
    an energy matrix is created which represents the change in RBG values between each pixel and its surrounding
    neighbors. With this data structure,
    a shortest paths search can be conducted and the seam with the lowest energy value (i.e. uninteresting content) is
    removed. </p>
  <p class="content">A naive solution,
    perhaps representing the energy matrix and picture as 2-d arrays of values,
    would require a running time of <em>O(n<sup>2</sup></em>) to remove a seam. My implementaion uses dynamic data
    structures which, on average, remove seams in time of <em>O(n)</em>. </p>

  <p class="content">Despite the fact that the underlying algorithm is quite simple and elegant. The SeamCarver
    technique was not discovered until 2007 by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. It is now a feature in Adobe Photoshop,
    as well as other popular computer graphics applications. </p>
